# Reduced MIPS Emulator Project
Reduced MIPS emulator written in Rust, plus a rom_writer.py script.

## CPU
- 32-bit Reduced MIPS architecture
- 32 32-bit registers
- 32-bit Program Counter register

## RAM
- 4 kB RAM
- 32-bit words

## TODO
### Short term
- Emulator / VM interface
- Change registers and RAM type from u32 and u8 to i32 and i8
### Mid term
- Floating point registers
- Clock speed simulation
### Long term
- Basic graphics and/or sound
